## 🎯 Key Strategic Decisions

### 1. **Pain-First Positioning**
- Avoided "AI-powered" buzzwords
- Led with emotional pain: "Stop losing customers to unanswered reviews"
- Focus on time savings and reputation protection, not technology

### 2. **Email-First Workflow**
- No dashboard to learn = major differentiator
- One-click approval ("Reply 'send it'")
- Mobile-friendly for on-the-go owners

### 3. **Competitor Intel as Premium Tier**
- $150/mo price jump justified by actionable weekly insights
- Specific, tactical recommendations (not generic data dumps)
- Positioned as offensive strategy (growth) vs. defensive (reputation)

### 4. **Trust-Building Elements**
- 30-day money-back guarantee with specific promise ("save 3 hours or refund")
- No automatic posting (human always approves)
- Transparent about public data sources for competitor intel
- No long-term contracts, cancel anytime

### 5. **Onboarding Focus on Brand Voice**
- Extensive voice/tone questions to avoid "robotic" responses
- Examples of words to always/never use
- Option to paste favorite past responses for style matching

### 6. **Competitor Newsletter Structure**
Each newsletter follows a proven format:
- What's working (steal these ideas)
- Competitor mistakes (avoid these, exploit their weakness)
- Menu/pricing trends (data-driven opportunities)
- Specific action items (prioritized, tactical)

**DON'T:**
- Tech jargon or "AI-powered" positioning
- Overpromise automation
- Corporate speak
- Vague benefits
