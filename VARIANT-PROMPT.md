## PROJECT OVERVIEW

**Product:** Maitreo - AI-powered reputation management for restaurants  
**URL:** maitreo.com  
**Target Audience:** Medium to high-end restaurant owners (1-5 locations)  
**Positioning:** "Your Digital Maître d' for Guest Experience & Reputation"

---

## VISUAL IDENTITY  - MINIMAL LUXURY PRECISION

### Design Philosophy
**Minimal luxury. Architectural. Precise.**

Think: Rimowa, Apple Pro, Stripe, high-end industrial design.

Clean. Confident. Restrained.

**No warmth. No decorative tones. No beige.**

### Color Palette (USE EXACTLY AS SPECIFIED)

**Primary Background - Pure White:** `#FFFFFF`
Use for: Most content areas

**Secondary Background - Soft Cool Gray:** `#F4F5F7`
Use for: Section contrast and layout separation

**Primary Text - Near Black:** `#111111`
Use for: Headlines and strong contrast areas

**Secondary Text - Neutral Gray:** `#6B6B6B`
Use for: Body copy and muted elements

**Dark Section Background - Deep Slate:** `#1F2A34`
Use for: Hero section, crisis section, final CTA section

**Accent Color - Structured Navy:** `#2B3A44`
Use for: Primary buttons, links, emphasis states

**Hover State - Darker Navy:** `#1E2A33`

**Subtle Divider / Line Color - Light Gray:** `#E6E8EB`

### CRITICAL CONSTRAINTS
**NO:**
- Beige, taupe, warm whites
- Wine red, gold accents
- Gradients
- Decorative shadows

### Typography

**Headlines (hospitality sophistication):**
- Playfair Display (preferred)
- OR Canela
- OR Cormorant Garamond

**Body Text (modern readability):**
- Inter (preferred)
- OR Neue Haas Grotesk
- OR SF Pro

**Rule:** Serif for presence. Sans-serif for function.

### Section Color Strategy
- Hero → Deep slate background (`#1F2A34`) + white text + navy CTA
- Feature sections → White background (`#FFFFFF`)
- Alternating sections → Soft cool gray (`#F4F5F7`)
- Crisis section → Deep slate background
- Comparison section → White
- Pricing section → Soft cool gray
- Final CTA → Deep slate background

Use gentle alternation to guide reading flow.

### Button Style
**Primary CTA:**
- Background: `#2B3A44`
- Text: White
- Border radius: 4-6px max
- **No glow. No gradient. No drop shadow.**
- Hover: Darken to `#1E2A33`

### Spacing & Layout
- **Generous whitespace**
- **Sharp alignment**
- No rounded SaaS cards
- No soft shadows
- No warm accents
- Thin line icons only  - ALL icons must be a single solid color (no multicolor, no gradients, no emoji-style)
- Everything feels engineered and precise

### Animation & Motion
- **Minimal animation only**
- Slow, smooth transitions
- No attention-grabbing motion
- Precision over decoration

### Mobile Responsiveness
- **CRITICAL:** Hero phone mockup must remain visible above fold on mobile
- Ensure all sections stack gracefully on small screens
- Maintain readability and hierarchy on all devices

### Accessibility
- **Maintain WCAG AA contrast minimum** for all text
- Ensure color combinations are readable
- Test with accessibility tools

---

## PAGE STRUCTURE (EXACT ORDER)

### 0. STICKY TOP NAV

**Layout:** Full-width, minimal height
- **Left:** "Maitreo" wordmark in serif (Playfair Display), white text on dark sections, dark text (#111111) on light sections
- **Right:** "Start Free Trial" button, small, navy (#2B3A44) background, white text, sharp corners (4-6px radius), no shadow
- **Background:** Light gray (#F4F5F7), solid. Clean separation from the dark hero.
- **NOT sticky.** Scrolls away with the page. Static position at top of hero only.
- **No other nav links.** Just logo + CTA. Clean and minimal.

---

### 1. HERO SECTION

**Background:** Dark (`#1F2A34`)

**Headline (Serif, large, white `#FFFFFF` text):**
```
Your Reputation Has a Maître d' Now.
```

**Subheadline (Sans-serif, white `#FFFFFF` text):**
```
Maitreo monitors every review, responds in your voice, and alerts you instantly when something needs attention  - all by SMS.
```

**Tension Statement (Sans-serif, smaller, soft gray `#F4F5F7`):**
```
Most restaurants discover reputation problems after guests stop coming. Maitreo notices the moment something feels off.
```

**CTA Button (Navy `#2B3A44`, prominent, sharp, no shadow):**
```
[ Start Free Trial ]
```

**Below button (small, muted text):**
```
7 days free. Cancel anytime before your trial ends.
No dashboard. No logins. Just intelligent alerts.
Works with Google, Yelp & TripAdvisor.
```

**Price Anchor (small, muted text `#6B6B6B`, below the supporting text):**
```
Less than the cost of one lost table per month.
```

**Supporting Bullet Row (Place directly below CTA, simple checkmarks in navy `#2B3A44` or white):**
```
✔ Monitors reviews every 15 minutes
✔ Auto-responds to positive feedback
✔ Instant alerts for negative reviews
✔ Detects patterns before ratings drop
✔ Weekly competitive intelligence
```

**Optional Trust Strip (very subtle, muted text):**
```
Trusted by restaurants that compete on experience  - not price.
```

**OR Authority Signal Alternative:**
```
Built specifically for independent premium restaurants.
```

**Platform Logos (below supporting bullets, muted monochrome):**
```
Google Reviews · Yelp · TripAdvisor
```
Small logo strip for visual credibility

**Visual Element  - Animated SMS Conversation (Phone Mockup):**

Show a phone mockup with an SMS conversation that animates sequentially. Each message appears one at a time with a subtle fade-in and slight upward slide (like real texts arriving). Pause ~2 seconds between each message.

**All icons/indicators must be monochrome**  - use navy `#2B3A44` or white only. No colored emoji. Replace emoji with simple monochrome symbols (checkmark, warning triangle, alert circle).

**Message sequence:**

```
[Maitreo]
✓ Auto-posted reply to 4.5★ review from Maria L. on Google
"Thank you, Maria! Evenings like yours are exactly why we do what we do here at The Pepper Room. We hope to welcome you back soon."
```
*(pause)*

```
[Maitreo]
⚠ New 2★ review from James R. on Yelp  - mentions long wait for entrées despite reservation.
Draft reply:
"James, we appreciate the feedback. A 40-minute wait is not the standard we hold ourselves to at The Pepper Room. We're addressing this with our kitchen team directly. Please reach out to us so we can discuss further."
Reply YES to post, or send your own.
```
*(pause)*

```
[You]
YES
```
*(pause)*

```
[Maitreo]
✓ Response posted to James's review.
```
*(pause)*

```
[Maitreo]
⚠ URGENT: 2 negative reviews in 6 hours.
Both mention slow service. Possible operational issue tonight.

Suggested actions:
· Check kitchen timing and staffing levels
· Short-staff on expo? Consider pulling a manager
· Monitor next 2 hours for additional signals
```

**Animation loops** after completing the full sequence (with a longer pause before restarting).

**Visual style:** No phone frame or device mockup. Floating SMS-style text bubbles directly on the dark hero background (#1F2A34). Above the bubbles, a centered nameplate: circle with letter "M" inside (#4A6274 circle, white text), "Maitreo" in small muted text below. iMessage contact style. Appears before the first bubble animates in.

Maitreo bubbles: white (#FFFFFF) with dark text (#111111). User reply bubbles: grey-blue (#4A6274) with white text, bold. Nameplate circle also #4A6274. Subtle rounded corners.

**Alert severity styling (for product realism):**
- Positive messages (auto-posted, confirmations): Plain white bubble, no border
- Negative review alert: White bubble with amber/gold left border (#C9A84C), ⚠ icon in amber
- URGENT alert: White bubble with muted red left border (#C45C5C), ⚠ icon in red
- "Reply YES to post" text: Bold
- User "YES" reply: Bold in the grey-blue bubble

**Micro-Interaction (small animated text cycling near bottom of hero):**
```
Monitoring Google…
Monitoring Yelp…
Monitoring TripAdvisor…
All clear.
```

```

**Cost of Inaction (smaller text, soft gray `#F4F5F7`):**

### 4. 3 PILLARS OVERVIEW SECTION

**Background:** Primary background (`#F4F5F7`)

**Section Headline (Serif, centered, primary text `#111111`):**
```
Three Pillars of Reputation Oversight
```

**3 Column Layout:**

**PILLAR 1  - Continuous Awareness**

```

---

### **Digest Preview (Primary Visual) - Designed Newsletter Panel**

Design a large, polished newsletter-style panel. Think Morning Brew or Stripe's annual reports. Not an email client, not plain text. A beautifully designed digest with visual hierarchy, data visualization, and clean layout.

**Panel header:**
- White card with subtle drop shadow, lifted off the #F4F5F7 background
- Top bar: "Maitreo Digest" in sans-serif (Inter) left-aligned, "The Pepper Room  - Week of Feb 3 - Feb 9" right-aligned, muted text
- All block headers in sans-serif (Inter), sentence case (not uppercase). No all-caps anywhere in the digest panel.
- Thin divider below header

**BLOCK 1 - This Week at a Glance**
Visual metric cards in a horizontal row (not plain text). Each metric in its own mini card:
- **14** new reviews (small green arrow, +40%)
- **4.6** avg rating (small green arrow up from 4.4)
- **18 min** response time
- **Improving** sentiment (small upward trend line icon)
- **None** risk signals (small checkmark)

**BLOCK 2 - Patterns We Noticed**
Left-bordered insight cards (thin navy #2B3A44 left border on each):
- "Slow service" in 3 reviews (up from 1 last week)
- Maria mentioned positively 5 times
- Outdoor seating praised repeatedly
- Noise complaints increased Friday nights

Each card should feel like a distinct insight, not a bullet list.

**BLOCK 3 - Competitor Watch**
Visual comparison layout:
- Miami Chop House: big bold "+12 reviews" with a small bar chart showing spike vs typical average of 4. Red "Growth anomaly" tag.
- Harbor Grill: "4.5 → 4.2" with a small downward arrow visualization
- Insight callout card: "Competitors praised for fast lunch service"

This block should feel strategic and data-rich.

**BLOCK 4 - Recommended Actions**
Clean checklist with checkbox styling (not plain text checkmarks):
- ☐ Investigate Friday dinner service timing
- ☐ Recognize Maria for guest experience impact
- ☐ Monitor Miami Chop House next 2 weeks
- ☐ Encourage guests to post food photos

Each item on its own line with generous spacing.

---

**Section Closing Line (centered, bold, primary text, below the digest panel):**
```
Most restaurants react to reviews. Maitreo helps you anticipate trends.
```

**Experience Framing (small, centered, muted text `#6B6B6B`):**
```
Coffee in hand. Clear perspective. Confident decisions for the week ahead.
```

---

### **Visual Design Requirements**

The digest panel should feel:
- ✔ Premium newsletter design (Morning Brew, Dense Discovery quality)
- ✔ Data visualizations (mini charts, trend arrows, metric cards)
- ✔ Clear visual hierarchy between the 4 blocks
- ✔ Large enough to read all content (NOT thumbnail-sized)
- ✔ White panel with subtle shadow on #F4F5F7 background
- ✔ Subtle section dividers between blocks
- ✔ Monochrome with navy #2B3A44 accents, light green/red allowed for directional data visualizations only (bar charts, trend arrows)

**AVOID:** Plain text lists. This should look designed, not typed.

---

### 6. COMPETITOR INTELLIGENCE SECTION

**Background:** Primary background (`#F4F5F7`)

**Section Headline (Serif, centered, primary text `#111111`):**
```
Know What's Happening Across the Street
```

**Explain Why This Matters (Sans-serif bullets):**
- Competitor momentum
- Sudden popularity spikes
- Service trends
- Positioning changes

**Example Visual:**
```
Miami Chop House: +12 reviews this week
Typical weekly average: 4
Growth anomaly detected
```

**Closing Line (centered, bold):**
```
Most restaurants only watch themselves. Maitreo watches the market.
```

---

### 7. DASHBOARD VS SMS VISUAL CONTRAST SECTION

**Background:** Primary background (`#F4F5F7`)

**Section Headline (Serif, centered, primary text `#111111`):**
```
Most Tools Give You Dashboards. Maitreo Sends a Text.
```

**Subheadline (Sans-serif, centered, primary text):**
```
One requires constant monitoring. The other only speaks when it matters.
```

---

### **Visual Layout (Side-by-Side Contrast)**

**The visual contrast must clearly communicate the difference even without animation.**

**Optional small divider label above both visuals:**
```
The Old Way → The Maitreo Way
```

---

**LEFT SIDE  - Complex Dashboard**

Create a visually dense, cognitively heavy mock interface showing:
- Multiple charts and graphs
- Platform tabs (Google, Yelp, TripAdvisor)
- Notification badges
- Filters and dropdowns
- Side navigation
- Data tables
- Sentiment analytics

**The dashboard should feel:**
- Busy
- Time-consuming
- Overwhelming
- Software-heavy

**Visual treatment:** Fully monochrome. Remove all colored elements (blue charts, green indicators, colored tabs). Use only grays, light gray fills, and dark text. All the complexity with no color relief.

**"vs" divider:** Add a small centered circle between the dashboard and SMS sides with "vs" inside. Navy (#2B3A44) circle with white text. Clean and minimal.

**Caption below dashboard (neutral gray `#6B6B6B`):**
```
"Another dashboard. Another login. Another thing to check."
```

---

**RIGHT SIDE  - Maitreo SMS**

Minimal phone frame — thin rounded rectangle outline only, no notch, no status bar, no home indicator, no device chrome. Just a clean container that reads as "phone." Maximizes space for the message content:

```
[Maitreo]
⚠ New 2★ Yelp review from James R.
Mentions long wait for entrées.
Draft reply: "James, we appreciate the feedback. A 40-minute wait is not the standard we hold ourselves to at The Pepper Room. We're addressing this with our kitchen team directly. Please reach out to us so we can discuss further."
Reply YES to post, or send your own.

[You]
YES

[Maitreo]
✓ Posted.
```

Same bubble styling as hero: white Maitreo bubbles, grey-blue (#4A6274) user bubble, amber left border on the alert.

**This side should feel:**
- Calm
- Clear
- Focused
- High contrast
- Minimal

**Caption below SMS (near black `#111111`):**
```
"No dashboard. No analysis. Just clarity."
```

---

**Closing Line (centered, bold, near black `#111111`):**
```
Stop checking dashboards. Let Maitreo check everything for you.
```

---

### **ANIMATION BEHAVIOR (OPTIONAL ENHANCEMENT)**

**The section must be effective without animation.**

**If animation is supported:**
- Subtle fade-in on scroll (dashboard first, SMS second)
- Slight dimming or desaturation of dashboard once SMS appears
- Smooth, understated transitions only
- **NO** bouncing, flashing, pulsing, or exaggerated motion

**If animation is not supported:**
The static visual contrast must clearly communicate: Complex dashboard vs. simple SMS clarity.

---

---

## TRUST MICROCOPY (SPRINKLE THROUGHOUT)

Add these subtle reassurance lines in appropriate sections:
- Replies match your voice
- You control negative responses
- Silent when everything is running smoothly
- Learns your tone from past replies or a short style prompt during setup
- **NOTE:** Review platform compliance before using "Fully compliant with review platforms"

---

## EMOTIONAL GOAL

Visitors should feel:
> "My reputation is being professionally attended to."

NOT:
> "I'm signing up for another software tool."

---

## CTA REPETITION RULE

**DO NOT REMOVE THIS RULE.**

CTAs (Call-to-Action buttons) appear in these locations:
1. **After Hero** - Primary CTA above fold
2. **After Pricing (Section 9)** - Convert on price decision
3. **Final Section (Section 12)** - Last chance conversion

All CTAs use navy (`#2B3A44`) with consistent button styling: sharp corners (4-6px radius max), no shadows, no gradients.

---

## FINAL REMINDER

**CRITICAL:** Follow these specifications EXACTLY. Use the exact copy provided. Use the exact colors specified. Follow the exact page structure. Do not add sections, change copy, or reinterpret the visual direction. Stay aligned to what is written above.

**Design Priorities:**
- **Minimal luxury precision** (Rimowa, Apple Pro, Stripe aesthetic)
- Mobile-first (hero mockup visible above fold on phones)
- Minimal, smooth animations only
- WCAG AA contrast compliance
- Platform logos for trust (Google, Yelp, TripAdvisor)
- Monitoring frequency emphasis (every 15 minutes)
- Sharp alignment, generous whitespace
- Thin line icons only  - ALL icons must be a single solid color (no multicolor, no gradients, no emoji-style)
- No warm tones, no gold, no decorative elements

Generate a landing page design that embodies **architectural precision and minimal luxury**  - engineered, confident, and restrained.

---

## DESIGN REVIEW NOTES (v1 feedback, apply to all future iterations)

1. **"What a Maître d' Does" icons too faint** - Need sharper, more distinct thin-line icons in navy #2B3A44. Eye, raised hand, clipboard should be clearly recognizable at a glance.
2. **Three Pillars icons too generic** - Radar (Continuous Awareness), message bubble (Intelligent Response), and graph/trends (Strategic Intelligence) need to be distinct and properly sized. Not placeholder-quality.
3. **Weekly Report preview too small** - The 4 blocks (Executive Snapshot, Patterns, Competitor Intel, Recommended Actions) must be large enough to read. This is a key selling section.
4. **Competitor Intel section needs more weight** - The Miami Chop House example (+12 reviews, typical average 4, growth anomaly detected) should be visually prominent, not buried in small text.
5. **Dashboard vs SMS contrast: dashboard side not busy enough** - Make the left dashboard mockup visually dense and overwhelming (charts, tabs, tables, notifications, filters). Sell the cognitive load contrast harder.
6. **Hero supporting bullet row missing** - The 5 checkmarks (monitors every 15 min, auto-responds, instant alerts, detects patterns, weekly intelligence) must be visible in the hero section.
7. **Testimonial cards need more distinction** - Add quotation marks, slightly different background, or subtle left border to make them feel like real quotes, not placeholder cards.
8. **All icons across entire page must be solid single-color, clearly rendered thin-line icons** - No faint or barely visible icons anywhere.
