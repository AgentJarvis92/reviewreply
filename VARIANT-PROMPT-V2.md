## PROJECT OVERVIEW

**Product:** Maitreo - AI-powered reputation management for restaurants
**URL:** maitreo.com
**Target Audience:** Medium to high-end restaurant owners (1-5 locations)

---

## VISUAL IDENTITY - DARK EDITORIAL LUXURY

### Design Philosophy
**Dark. Editorial. Cinematic. Architectural.**

Think: Aman Resorts website, Bottega Veneta, Aesop, high-end architectural photography books.

The entire page lives on a dark background. Content is revealed through contrast, typography, and photography. This is a luxury hospitality brand, not a SaaS dashboard.

### Color Palette (USE EXACTLY)

**Primary Background - Near Black:** `#0D0D0D`
Use for: Most of the page

**Card/Section Background - Dark Charcoal:** `#1A1A1A`
Use for: Cards, panels, bordered sections

**Accent Background - Deep Slate:** `#1F2A34`
Use for: Feature highlight sections, hero overlay

**Primary Text - White:** `#FFFFFF`
Use for: Headlines, strong text

**Secondary Text - Warm Gray:** `#9CA3AF`
Use for: Body copy, descriptions, muted elements

**Muted Text - Dark Gray:** `#6B6B6B`
Use for: Labels, captions, small text

**Accent/Interactive - Warm White:** `#E8E4DF`
Use for: Buttons, borders, hover states

**Border Color - Subtle Gray:** `#2A2A2A`
Use for: Card borders, dividers, outlines

**Alert Amber:** `#C9A84C`
**Alert Red:** `#C45C5C`
**SMS User Bubble:** `#4A6274`

### CRITICAL CONSTRAINTS
**NO:**
- White backgrounds anywhere
- Light gray (#F4F5F7) sections
- Colorful gradients
- Drop shadows
- Rounded, bubbly SaaS aesthetics

### Typography

**Headlines:**
- Playfair Display (preferred) OR a refined serif
- UPPERCASE with generous letter-spacing (0.15-0.25em)
- Large, bold, architectural presence

**Body Text:**
- Inter (preferred)
- Regular weight, generous line-height (1.6-1.8)
- Warm gray (#9CA3AF) on dark backgrounds

**Small Labels/Overlines:**
- Inter, uppercase, letter-spacing 0.2em
- Muted color, 10-12px

**Rule:** Headlines are monumental. Body is quiet. Labels are whispered.

### Section Strategy
- **Hero:** Full-bleed restaurant photography with text overlay on dark
- **All other sections:** Dark background (#0D0D0D) with content
- **Variation comes from:** Typography scale, photography placement, bordered cards vs open layout
- **Rhythm:** Large photo sections alternate with typographic sections

### Button Style
**Primary CTA:**
- Border: 1px solid #E8E4DF (warm white outline)
- Text: #FFFFFF, uppercase, letter-spacing 0.15em, 13-14px
- Background: transparent
- Hover: Fill white, text goes dark
- **No rounded corners. No shadows. No gradients.**

### Photography
Use high-quality, dark, moody restaurant photography:
- Dimly lit dining rooms
- Close-ups of table settings
- Architectural details (pendant lights, bar counters, wood textures)
- All images should feel editorial and cinematic
- Desaturated, warm-tone grading

### Spacing & Layout
- **Very generous whitespace** (120-160px between sections)
- **Content max-width: 1200px** centered
- **2-column layouts** use asymmetric splits (40/60 or 30/70)
- **Cards use thin borders** (#2A2A2A), not fills or shadows
- **Icons: thin line, white or warm gray, 24-28px**

### Mobile Responsiveness
- Single column stacking on mobile
- Headlines scale down (max 28px on mobile)
- Photography sections become shorter on mobile
- All content must be readable and well-spaced on 375px

---

## DESIGN PRINCIPLES SUMMARY

1. **Dark background everywhere** - No white sections. No light gray. Dark, dark, dark.
2. **Photography is key** - 2-3 full-bleed restaurant photos break up the typography sections
3. **Uppercase serif headlines** with generous letter-spacing = architectural presence
4. **Bordered cards** (thin #2A2A2A borders) instead of filled/shadowed cards
5. **Outlined buttons** (white border, transparent fill) not filled buttons
6. **SMS shown as structured intelligence** not casual chat bubbles
7. **Labels/overlines** above every section (uppercase, letter-spaced, muted)
8. **Generous whitespace** (120-160px between sections minimum)
9. **Typography does the heavy lifting** - minimal decorative elements
10. **Monochrome** except amber/red for alert severity indicators

## MOBILE RULES
- Single column stacking
- Headlines max 28px
- Photography sections shorter
- Full-width outlined buttons (48px height)
- 16px horizontal padding
- All content readable at 375px

## FINAL REMINDER

Follow every specification exactly. Use the exact copy. Use the exact colors. Follow the exact structure. This should feel like a luxury hospitality brand's website, not a technology product page. Cinematic. Editorial. Precise.

No em dashes anywhere. No warm tones beyond the photography. No bubbly SaaS aesthetic.

Generate a landing page that makes restaurant owners feel like they're being offered membership to an exclusive intelligence service for their reputation.
