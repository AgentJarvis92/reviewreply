## PROBLEM SECTION

### Headline
**You're Too Busy Running Your Restaurant to Protect Its Reputation**

### Pain Points (3 columns)

**📱 Reviews Pile Up**
Every day without a response costs you customers. Google and Yelp rankings drop. New diners see silence and keep scrolling.

**⏰ No Time to Respond**
Between inventory, staff, health inspections, and actually cooking—who has time to craft thoughtful responses to 47 reviews?

**🤷 What Are Competitors Doing?**
That new place down the street is packed. What's their secret? Their reviews? Their menu? You're too buried to find out.

**Q: Do I have to use your exact responses?**
Nope. Edit them however you want, or just reply "send it" if it's perfect. You're always in control.

We flag sensitive reviews and provide response options with different tones. You pick the approach. For legal/serious issues, we recommend you handle directly.
